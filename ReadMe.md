# VeryBasicMVVM
MVVM Skeleton for learning the architecture, including the followings:

- Retrofit
- LiveData
- RecyclerView

This project is very basic and not complicated to understand, I wrote some notes that I hope will help you.

This is the order:
- First created the model.
- Created the Api Request.
- Created the Repository.
- Created the ViewModel.
- And finally,in the MainActivity we get the data from the ViewModel by Observe and display it to the user.

Tip - When you stuck and don't know what to do now, just look at the pattern and try to understand what are you trying to do.
